          <strong>Lea Wallnoffer</strong> is a Fashion Designer at <em>Swiss Fashion Academy</em>. Born in Switzerland, she has lived in London extensively but recently returned to her homecountry to teach her passion. She loves walking around in captivating unique places and  discovering the beauty of  hidden nature.

          I love wandering through the captivating panorama of Switzerland, finding new places popping up at every corner. The country is constantly reinventing itself which was one of the reason I came back to my home land after many years abroad. When asked about my experience, I can only respond:
        </p>
        <blockquote>Switzerland is an existing fairyland  of my dreams: Modernity and tradition and the nature are fusing together and constantly give birth to new creations of a  beauty  Paradise. It is true that the country is small. The greenery nature ,alps and lakes combined together  bathing the country in its signature glow  of serenity and giving me life.</blockquote>
        <p>
          Now teaching at <em>Swiss Fashion Academy</em> I spend my days in the institute, but the morning is when I truly come alive. Waking up and the first thing I could set my eyes on is nature, I discover the most <strong>astonishing, serene, beautiful place</strong>. Many people are questioning my love for Switzerland's imperfections, but as in the art of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wabi-sabi">Wabi-sabi</a>, true beauty often lies beneath the surface.

          I hope that more and more people will see the true beauty of Switzerland soon. It is a captivating beast that you won't be able to take your eyes off again. Explore the nature in your own pace and <u>discover things you have never seen before</u>.
